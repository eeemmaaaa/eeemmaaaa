## 👋 Hi, I'm Ning

I am transitioning into **Data Science and Computer Science**, with a strong interest in applying machine learning to complex, real-world data problems.

My background includes structured data analysis, classical machine learning, and deep learning, with hands-on projects involving both structured datasets and high-dimensional data. I am particularly interested in building reliable data pipelines, understanding model behavior, and interpreting results in a rigorous and reproducible manner.
