## 👋 Hi, I'm Ning

I am transitioning into **Bioinformatics and Data Science**, with a strong interest in applying machine learning to biological and medical data.

My background combines structured data analysis, classical machine learning, and deep learning, with recent projects focusing on **gene expression analysis** and **medical imaging**. I am particularly interested in building correct data pipelines, understanding model behavior, and interpreting results in a scientific context.
